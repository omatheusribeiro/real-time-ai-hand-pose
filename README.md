# 🤖 Hand Pose Application

## 📌 Overview
The **Hand Pose Application** is a dynamic system designed to detect hand pose positions using the **TensorFlow** library. 🚀

This repository contains an implementation of:

✅ **Real-Time Hand Pose Detection** 🤚🖐️👌

## 📝 Description 
The objective of this application is to identify hand pose positions by leveraging the power of the **TensorFlow** library. The system reads the user's hand and identifies key movement points, providing an effective hand pose detection mechanism. The goal is to explore new recognition methods using **JavaScript** and to acquire new knowledge in the process.
